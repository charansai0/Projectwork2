## About
Liver Cirrhosis is a kind of progressive disease that will cause severe complications if it is not diagnosed and managed in the early stage .Here in this disease the healthy liver tissues are replaced with fibrotic scar tissues which can lead to slow the function of liver gradually. Liver cirrhosis is a major disease globally where it resulting conditions like chronic hepatitis infections , excessive alcohol consumption and some metabolic disorders .Nearly 2.1 million people were effected with liver cirrhosis annually and over1.5 million people deaths are taking place. Especially in India 50,000 cases were noted annually and 7000 people are dead. In our project we use deep neural network that has gained lot a recognition for its ability to analyze the complex patterns , extra meaning full features and improve classification across many medical domains .There are some Traditional diagnostic methods to find the stage of liver cirrhosis including liver biopsies, imaging techniques and clinical assessments which provide valuable information but in limit. Applying DNN for liver cirrhosis offers a scalable , accurate and data driven approach that can enhance the clinical decision making. This study mainly focus on developing a deep neural network based system to predict liver cirrhosis with high accuracy of.The proposed model will integrate diverse patient data to classify the liver cirrhosis stages for early detection and personalized treatment planning Liver cirrhosis is a chronic disease that can leads to a condition called liver fibrosis if it is not detected in the early stage and managed very Accurate than staging of cirrhosis diseases gets very critical for guiding so that the treatment decisions and predicting diseases progression will become complex .Conventional diagnostic approaches or the methods that are used for the detection is used Such as the liver biopsies and imaging techniques can be invasive, expensive and subject to inter-observer variability. To overcome all these limitations this study presented a method called deep neural network based approach for automated liver cirrhosis stage prediction using a combination of clinical and imaging where this is an very accurate model for detecting the disease data The proposed model integrates multiple layers of deep learning to extract complex features from structured clinical records biochemical markers and medical imaging . A hybrid frameworks incorporating convolutional neural networks for image processing and fully connected layers for tabular clinical data is designed to enhance predictive performance . The dataset used for training and validation comprises patient demographics ,laboratory test results and imaging scans ensuring a multi-modal learning approach
